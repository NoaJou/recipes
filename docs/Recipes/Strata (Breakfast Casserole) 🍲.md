> Serves: 12
### Ingredients
- 12 large eggs
- 3 cups whole milk (or half & half)
- 1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese (off the block)
- 1 1/2 cup shredded smoked gouda cheese (off the block)
- 1 cup chopped deli ham
- 1 cup chopped scallions
- 3/4 cup chopped roasted red pepper
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 teaspoon ground mustard
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 12 ounce loaf french bread
### Steps
1. Set out a large mixing bowl and a 9X13 inch (3 quart) baking dish. Grease the baking dish. Chop all necessary ingredients.
2. In the mixing bowl, add the eggs, milk, salt, ground mustard, and garlic powder. Whisk well to break up all the yolks. Then stir in the cheeses, ham, scallions, and roasted red pepper.
3. Tear the bread loaf into 1-2 inch chunks and place them in the baking dish. 
4. Pour the egg mixture over the top of the bread. Use a spatula to fold the bread over, gently, to make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed. Cover and chill until ready to bake.
5. Let the strata recipe rest for **at least one hour**, so the bread soaks up all the eggs. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. (This is a fabulous make-ahead overnight recipe, so you can also preheat the oven in the morning.)
6. Bake, uncovered, for 50-60 minutes, until the top is golden-brown and puffy in the center. Insert a sharp knife into the center to check that the eggs are set. If not, bake another 5-10 minutes. Then cool for 5 minutes before cutting. Serve warm!
